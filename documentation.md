## Introduction
This particular documentation is going to cover the fourth stage of the chosen design methodology (Design Thinking) known as prototyping where the second part of the implementation will be presented in the form of coded prototype that can provide a more realistic and dynamic version of the project before presenting it to the end user in order to be tested in the last stage of the design process known as the testing phase.


One of the most well-known problems that students face throughout their studies is the time management of their assessment projects; many of them fail to set a proper time management and eventually wind up overwhelmed with loads of work to complete, especially if they have to work on more than one project at the same time. Moreover, many students undervalue the power of project time managements tools, which results in serious difficulty to get them adapted with the work process and work flow in the field and the pressure of more than a project once. 

> Therefore, the suggested solution to attempt solving this problem is an integrated platform on student portal website that can offer a number of options such as timelines, task lists and more; in which the student will be able to focus on the university services and not get lost in the uncountable paid or free platforms available online. This is aiming to familiarise students with the concept of management tools while also establishing the habit of being organise.

Throughout this particular documentation, the main focus will be given to development process of the front-end and the back-end sides of this project in order to document all the used tools and techniques to achieve this phase.

> It is worth to mention that this particular implementation phase has been developed mainly based on self-learning and self-research process. Therefore, some of the chosen approaches may not be as sophisticated as It may be required. However, a big effort has been to learn and develop component from the start, especially for someone whose sees himself more as a designer than a developer.



## Methodology

As stated in the first part of the assessment, the chosen approach to process this project is the design thinking methodology, in which the first three stages have been already completed and documented in the submitted report.

Several challenges have been faced during the implementation of the realistic prototype, which required conducing a number of research and self learning in order to figure out how certain elements of the project can be developed.

Most of the parts of the client side (Front-End) have been successfully developed based on single page web application concept as demonstrated in the first part of the assessment.

Most of the parts of the client side (Front-End) have been successfully developed based on single page web application concept as demonstrated in the first part of the assessment.

Whereas, the server side (back-end) have been partially completed, which made the application not a hundred percent as dynamic designed and some secondary features are not completed as designed throughout the design process. Nonetheless, the primary back end server side feature have been completed such as the login system, the hosting, the data adding and other features using ReactJS, Firebase hosting and serve side, as well as few other react libraries to handle form validation and the responsive web versions (Hookform, Material Design for Bootstrap 5 & React 18)

Moving towards the fifth stage of the chosen methodology and in order to test the current version of this application, a short quiz survey has been conduced in which over 10 participants rated the app in various aspects such as: 

- Content accessibility
- The responsive version (mobile, tablet, and desktop)
- Visibility
- Content Information

The results of the quiz have shown a positive and encouraging feedback from the targeted end user, where almost all the identified aspect have been rated three points out of five. These can be seen positive responses from the potential end users, but at the same time it doesnâ€™t mean there are no weaknesses. Instead, this clearly helped to identify areas that should be ameliorated in conjunction with the uncompleted features from the UI/UX design concept.

The quiz results can be found at the following link: https://forms.office.com/Pages/AnalysisPage.aspx?AnalyzerToken=M9bhUTx78m5kfTNjXgqO2Fzn1Dt4MGEJ&id=zeSE1hpJd0W_M1RkeNcuPLnqxA3M8txMvAIdOhUbJfJUME8wVzBFOVcwNEFQNEMyUjI5NFpCNUFGVS4u

> The quiz results may not provide a deep version of the testing. However, it can certainly provide an understanding to know whether the current progress is something we can build on or not. Thus, these feedbacks only be considered as positive responses for the potential end users that can be taken as basis for future improvements.

## Conclusion/Results

To summarize, it is important to mention that the concept of this application has been built based on a basic task management tool that offers basic industry standard. However, the targeted goal is improving the app to meet the industry standard with a view to be integrated on the portal app for future students' usage. 

The project concept is clearly based on a big scale idea where team members of different experts are required, not only to take various parts needed to complete the project, but also to enrich the various perspectives of the people involved to launch it. In this context and from a realistic point of view, the application still lacks a number of fundamental features that have been already developed at the front end side as well as UX side, but still need to be completed at the server side. 


The value of time is one of the most important elements in the industry, which the majority of experts would agree with. Thus, it is essential to remind the reader that the main purpose of this project is to create a task management tool that can help students not only familiarize themselves with the industry tools, but also manage their time to the best possible. 

Therefore, this project should be seen as a start of an ongoing development where various task management features can be added to prepare Solent students with basic management tool and techniques that are essential according to the industry standards.
