# Task Management Tool | Web Application

Time is known to be as the most valuable and limited asset that everyone has. Thus, a good project management approach will certainly have a substantial positive impact on the project's scope, budget, and effectiveness.

In this context, one of the most well-known problems that students face throughout their studies is the time management of their assessment projects; many of them fail to set a proper time management and eventually wind up overwhelmed with loads of work to complete, especially if they have to work on more than one project at the same time. Moreover, many students undervalue the power of project time managements tools, which results in serious difficulty to get them adapted with the work process and work flow in the field and the pressure of more than a project once.

Therefore, the suggested solution to attempt solving this problem is an integrated platform on student portal website that can offer a number of options such as timelines, task lists and more; in which the student will be able to focus on the university services and not get lost in the uncountable paid or free platforms available online. This is aiming to familiarise students with the concept of management tools while also establishing the habit of being organise.

At the same time, this will increase students engagement with the university platforms and open several business opportunities for many companies to present their products to students on the app.
